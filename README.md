# Say What? 🧯

Welcome to **Say What?**, a hybrid app that blends *real operational metrics* with *playful storytelling* to highlight how support roles quietly hold your company together.

## 🔍 Why This Exists

Payroll delayed? Reimbursements bottlenecked? 1099s forgotten?  

That’s not “just admin.” That’s *revenue on fire* and compliance lawsuits knocking.

This project:

- Simulates how delays in support tasks can create costly business failures

- Offers a lighthearted “meltdown mode” to imagine the chaos

- Advocates for giving support teams their long-overdue credit

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Streamlit dashboard simulating core support metrics:

 - Payroll compliance risk

- Expense backlog → employee satisfaction impact

- 1099/Census → penalty estimations

- Story mode: A narrative simulation of a CEO meltdown

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This is an exploratory concept. I'm early in my data journey, and this project is part of learning to connect business logic, storytelling, and tech in meaningful ways.
