## 🔍 Why This Exists

Payroll delayed? Reimbursements bottlenecked? 1099s forgotten?  

That’s not “just admin.” That’s *revenue on fire* and compliance lawsuits knocking.

This project:

- Simulates how delays in support tasks can create costly business failures

- Offers a lighthearted “meltdown mode” to imagine the chaos

- Advocates for giving support teams their long-overdue credit

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Streamlit dashboard simulating core support metrics:

 - Payroll compliance risk

- Expense backlog → employee satisfaction impact

- 1099/Census → penalty estimations

- Story mode: A narrative simulation of a CEO meltdown

## How to Use:

1. Input the tasks and roles of support staff.

2. Let the app calculate the financial impact.

3. View insights on how these tasks contribute to the company’s bottom line.
